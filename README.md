# ESPresso32
TODO: This README is Work in progress

The goal of this project is to create a espresso scale with a ESP32 as a base
with BLE connection and a coresponding Android App.

The ESP32 is programmed with the Andrino IDE.

## ESP32

### Software
You need the Arduino IDE to flash the software.
Only flash the espresso32.ino file this is all.

Now you can install the Android app or use direct BLE
to communicate with the scale.

### Hardware setup
Beside of the software i have a simple hardware setup which should only be a
example without warranty.

List of components:
- ESP32
- Load cell
- HX711
- Battery holder
- lifepo4 accumulator
- Step up converter
- Other small parts like wires etc

## Android
You can install the app from the Playstore or build the app from the source.
